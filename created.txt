D:
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /K "cd \projects\VSrepository"

Create repository "MyGitTest" somewhere, suggest in "D:\projects\VSrepository"
Create empty solution in that repository:  MyTwoTests
At "MyTwoTests" in Solution Explorer add project using Console App (.NET Framework) named "ConsoleApp1"
Add "Hello World" in program.cs as shown below here
namespace ConsoleApp1
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
	    Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}


Click on "Save All"

At "MyTwoTest" in Solution Explorer add 
	using "Web - ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework)" named "WebApplication1" and click "OK"
	after the OK, select "Empty", put an X in the checkbox "[]Web Forms" and click "OK"

At "WebApplication1" in Solution Explorer, add "New Item", scroll down to "Web Form" and
	change the name from "WebForm1.aspx" to "Default.aspx" then click "ADD"
	Select "Default.aspx" in Solution Explorer, ensure that "Design" is selected and
	position your cursor in the colored horizontal outlined box  at the top of the frame.
	Add the phrase "Hello World" in the just below "div" in that same box.

Click on "Save All" and select "Build Solution".  There should be two successes.


In the Solution Explorer, right click on WebSolution1, select "Debug" then click on "Start New Instance"  
	the program will run.  Stop the program by first selecting (up at top of VS2017) the DEBUG - STOP DEBUGGING
	then close the windows that shows "hello world"

Repeat for the console program.  To stop that program click on the console window and press the return key.
